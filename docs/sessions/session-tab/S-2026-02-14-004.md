# ODRC Updates — Session Tab
# Date: 2026-02-14
# Session: S-2026-02-14-004 (Session lifecycle, detection loop, landing page cards, idea maturity model, skill authoring principles)
# Idea: session-tab
# IdeaId: -OlO6yEDlG9FFkjXgAxl
# App: command-center
# Context: Single-link exploration session that designed the session dispatch/detection loop, transformed the landing page from idea cards to session cards, established the full idea maturity lifecycle (inception through spec-built), and defined skill authoring principles. Cascading insights connected detection → tracking → lifecycle → card model → idea maturity → skill philosophy.

## ODRC Updates

- NEW DECISION: "The session brief embeds a session ID and idea slug that become the required signature in the output filename. CC tracks dispatched sessions (brief generated) and watches for their return (outcome uploaded). The brief creates the contract, the output fulfills it — closing the loop that caused the stale brief problem."
- NEW DECISION: "Only the final summation package carries the CC-recognizable filename signature ({idea-slug}-{session-id}.json or .zip). Link packages are intermediate chain artifacts with no naming contract to CC. The cc-summation-link skill is the single point where the brief's session metadata flows into the output filename."
- NEW DECISION: "CC ingests link packages throughout the chain as a file collector and delivery service. Chat always owns summation. CC tracks and stores link artifacts as they arrive, provides them back as a consolidated zip when Chat needs link briefs for summation. CC never builds the summation itself."
- NEW DECISION: "CC's landing page displays active chain progress for dispatched sessions — showing which link artifacts have been received, chain health status, ODRC velocity, and providing a one-click Download Link Package action that bundles all collected link artifacts into a zip for upload to the summation link in Chat."
- NEW DECISION: "A session is a single object that transitions through states: dispatched → active → complete. The live landing page view and the historical session tab view are the same data at different lifecycle stages. When summation is ingested, the session closes and its full record persists as the session history entry — nothing from the live view is discarded."
- NEW DECISION: "The landing page displays session cards, not idea cards. Session state (pending/active/complete) and idea state (inception/exploring/converging/spec-ready/spec-built) are independent dimensions shown on the same card. When a session completes, the card resets to pending session state while retaining the idea's current phase."
- NEW DECISION: "Sessions maintain a strict one-to-one relationship with ideas. All edge cases — merging ideas, reconciling ODRC across ideas, creating parent/child idea hierarchies — are CC backend management concerns, not session protocol concerns. The session process produces clean single-idea output; CC's backend handles reconciliation and cross-idea management as separate workflows."
- NEW DECISION: "Idea state includes inception as the first phase preceding exploring. At inception the idea has a provisional name and topic sentence. The first session brief includes a directive to validate the idea definition — challenge the name, pressure-test the topic sentence, confirm the end goal. Once validated or reframed, the idea advances to exploring."
- NEW DECISION: "Developers set the initial idea state at creation. CC defaults to inception but the developer can override to any maturity phase. When an advanced state is declared with no ODRC history, the session focuses on extracting and formalizing the developer's existing knowledge into structured ODRC — capturing decisions already made rather than re-exploring."
- NEW DECISION: "When a developer declares an advanced maturity state, Chat runs a lightweight state validation — 3-4 targeted questions calibrated to what someone at that phase should know. If answers reveal gaps, Chat suggests stepping back. Never blocks forward progress — surfaces the signal, developer decides."
- NEW DECISION: "CC implements File System Access API directory watching for Chrome users — one-time setup to grant access to Downloads folder, CC polls for session packages matching known signatures, surfaces a banner prompting ingestion. Safari/Firefox users get graceful degradation. Complemented by a universal staleness safeguard at brief generation."
- NEW DECISION: "CC implements a brief generation safeguard using state tracking. When a brief is downloaded, CC records the event per idea. If the user returns without having uploaded session output, CC prompts: 'You downloaded a session brief but never uploaded session results. Do you have output to provide?' Works in all browsers."
- NEW DECISION: "Link artifacts carry a metadata header block: session ID, idea slug, link number, artifact type, declared purpose, purpose achievement, start/end timestamps (optional), and ODRC counts (decisions, OPENs resolved, OPENs new, rules, constraints). CC uses this header for association, ordering, and chain progress display."
- NEW DECISION: "Session skills document principles, intent, and guardrails — not scripted behaviors. Chat has the intelligence to execute nuanced judgment calls from clear principles. Skills define what should happen and why, not step-by-step how. Over-prescribing produces rigid sessions."
- NEW DECISION: "Ideas remain on the landing page as active work across session cycles. Completing a session doesn't remove the card — it resets to pending with updated ODRC state. The idea leaves the landing page at a terminal state (spec built, shipped, or explicitly archived)."
- NEW RULE: "Keep the session-to-idea interface simple and rigid. Complexity belongs in CC's backend management layer, not in the session protocol. This separation means session skills never need to account for multi-idea scenarios."
- NEW RULE: "Every new idea defaults to inception state. Developer can override at creation. First session for inception-state ideas must validate the idea definition before deep exploration."
- NEW RULE: "State validation is a brief calibration exercise, not an interrogation. Three to four questions, first five minutes. If answers are confident, move on. If vague, suggest stepping back. Never block forward progress."
- NEW RULE: "If a behavior can't be captured in 2-3 sentences of principle, it's too prescriptive for a skill. Simplify to intent and trust Chat's reasoning. Iterate based on observed session quality."
- NEW CONSTRAINT: "File System Access API (showDirectoryPicker) is not supported in Safari or Firefox — only Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge). Directory watching for session package detection requires Chrome. All-browser fallback uses state-based staleness warnings."
- NEW OPEN: "What does idea management look like in CC — merging ideas, parent/child hierarchies, cross-idea ODRC reconciliation? (parked for future)"
- NEW OPEN: "Should CC preserve idea evolution history (renames, reframes, pivots) as a first-class feature? The journey from initial concept to final form has value. (parked for future)"
- NEW OPEN: "Is the chain model always the right structure, or are there session types where a single deep link produces better results? Exploration sessions with cascading insights may flow better continuous. (emerged from session experience)"
- NEW OPEN: "What does the session package content signature look like for directory watching? Filename pattern matching vs content-based detection (e.g., a known JSON key like cc-session-package: true) vs both?"
- NEW OPEN: "For Chrome directory watching, does CC poll on a timer or only on tab focus/mount? Should session detection be more aggressive than completion file polling?"
- NEW OPEN: "Does the summation link always have the original brief metadata (session ID, slug) available? The session ID needs to survive through every restart doc to reach summation — is this already part of the restart doc format or does it need to be added?"
- NEW OPEN: "What does the inception brief template look like? It needs to include the validation directive — challenge the name, test the topic sentence, confirm the end goal — while still being structured enough for Chat to run a productive session."

## Session Notes

### What Was Accomplished
This session started from a real workflow gap — completing session work but forgetting to upload artifacts before generating the next brief. That concrete problem cascaded into a comprehensive redesign of the session lifecycle, landing page model, and idea maturity tracking.

The core insight was that CC should actively track dispatched sessions and watch for their return, creating a closed loop between brief generation and session output ingestion. This expanded into CC becoming a file collector for the entire chain (not just the final package), which transformed the landing page from static idea cards into a live session dashboard showing chain progress, ODRC velocity, and one-click handoff actions.

The session also established that ideas should start in an inception state where the first session validates the idea definition itself, that developers should be able to override the default maturity state at creation, and that Chat should run lightweight state validation without gatekeeping. A key architectural principle emerged: skills should document principles and intent, not scripted behaviors — trusting Chat's reasoning for nuanced judgment.

### Key Design Principles Established
- The brief creates the detection contract; the output fulfills it — CC always knows what to watch for
- CC is a collector and delivery service, never a summarization engine — Chat owns intelligence
- Session cards and idea state are independent dimensions on the same card — lifecycle and maturity tracked separately
- Keep session protocol simple and rigid; all complexity lives in CC's backend
- Ideas are born messy — inception state acknowledges this and validates before committing
- Trust the developer's self-assessment, surface signals when it doesn't match, never gatekeep
- Skills express principles, not scripts — 2-3 sentences of intent over pages of procedure

### Session Status
- Concepts: 7 OPENs (new), 15 DECISIONs, 4 RULEs, 1 CONSTRAINTs
- Phase: converging (session lifecycle designed, landing page model established, detection loop specified — implementation and validation remain)
- Next session: Define the link artifact metadata format in detail and update cc-link-output skill. Update cc-summation-link with filename signature requirement. Design the inception brief template. Consider whether cc-post-session-package updates are needed for the new staleness tracking fields.
