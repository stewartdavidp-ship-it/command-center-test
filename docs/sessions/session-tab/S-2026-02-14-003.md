# ODRC Updates — Session Tab
# Date: 2026-02-13
# Session: S-2026-02-13-S002-Chain (Session-to-CC pipeline: chain model, purpose-driven links, summation workflow, skill production)
# Idea: session-tab
# IdeaId: [pending — assign at ingestion]
# App: command-center
# Context: Three-link chain plus summation that evolved session output from single-session uploads to a chain-based workflow. Produced four skill files codifying the chain model, link output format, summation workflow, and updated ODRC/session frameworks. Key insight: making session transitions cheap changes developer behavior from squeezing degrading sessions to starting fresh.

## ODRC Updates

### Decisions (S001 — carried forward, not modified this chain)

- PRIOR DECISION: "session.json is the single data source for the CC processor — all session metadata, ODRC pointers, and artifact references live in this file"
- PRIOR DECISION: "ODRC items stored in JSON format, not markdown — enables programmatic parsing and manipulation by CC"
- PRIOR DECISION: "Debrief is a separate .md file referenced in session.json — keeps narrative content out of structured data"
- PRIOR DECISION: "Handoff/debrief is first-class in Firebase — stored and queryable, not buried in file archives"
- PRIOR DECISION: "Minimal viable schema, iterate from usage — don't over-specify before real data reveals what's needed"
- PRIOR DECISION: "Artifact types are open-ended — no fixed enum, CC accepts what sessions produce"
- PRIOR DECISION: "Naming: zip is fully qualified (includes idea, session, date), internals are generic (session.json, debrief.md, etc.)"

### Decisions (Link 1 — chain model foundations)

- NEW DECISION: "Sessions chain without returning to CC between links. CC ingestion is deferred until chain completion. This reduces overhead, lets sessions hand off directly to each other, and makes CC packages represent complete arcs of thinking rather than fragments."
- NEW DECISION: "Each chain link produces two artifacts: a restart doc (narrative-first, for the next Claude instance) and a link brief (dense structured summary, for eventual summation). Separating consumers keeps each artifact focused on its audience."
- NEW DECISION: "Chains follow an N+1 model: N working links plus 1 dedicated summation link. The summation link runs at full context capacity with no ideation workload, producing the CC-ingestible package."
- NEW DECISION: "Summation reads transcripts as primary source, link briefs as fallback, restart doc as last resort. Three-tier input priority ensures best available fidelity."
- NEW DECISION: "Primary success metric is warm-up speed in Session N+1, not package completeness. The output is only as good as its ability to get the next session productive fast."
- NEW DECISION: "The debrief is the highest-value artifact in the session package. It carries the narrative arc, breakthroughs, tensions, and contextual understanding that structured ODRC items cannot convey."
- NEW DECISION: "Landing page workflow validates design direction — CC's session tab UX confirmed through walkthrough."

### Decisions (Link 2 — chain mechanics and operational philosophy)

- NEW DECISION: "Each chain link declares a purpose: 3-4 specific OPENs to resolve. The prior link's restart doc proposes the next purpose. This scopes context, focuses the session, and makes progress measurable."
- NEW DECISION: "Link purpose is advisory, not enforced. Chat captures tangents as OPENs, acknowledges them, and redirects. Developer can always override. The system guides without gatekeeping."
- NEW DECISION: "Tangent OPENs get idea affinity at capture — chat asks 'does this relate to an existing idea?' at the moment of capture. Prevents orphan OPENs from accumulating without deferring categorization."
- NEW DECISION: "Summation link is primarily autonomous — chat presents consolidation plan, developer approves/adjusts, chat produces the full package. Editorial oversight, not co-authoring."
- NEW DECISION: "Summation link prompt is a skill (cc-summation-link) — repeatable complex pattern that benefits from iteration and versioning."
- NEW DECISION: "Don't solve transcript availability in design — test empirically with briefs-only and evaluate by downstream warm-up speed."
- NEW DECISION: "Quality measured downstream — summation output quality measured by next session's first 1-2 exchanges, not package completeness metrics."
- NEW DECISION: "Session value rating (1-10) at ingestion time — single tap, low friction. No second rating point until adoption of first is validated."
- NEW DECISION: "Split output into two skills: cc-link-output (working links) and cc-summation-link (summation + CC package format). cc-post-session-package retires after validation."
- NEW DECISION: "Phase calculation stays ratio-based and advisory — developer decides when to advance. Revisit if rating data shows patterns."
- NEW DECISION: "Chain length 3-5 links recommended — chat check-in at link 3. Not enforced, nudged. Beyond 5, context fatigue and summation quality degrade."

### Decisions (Link 3 — skill production)

- NEW DECISION: "cc-link-output skill defines restart doc + link brief format for working links. Restart doc is narrative-first and self-contained; link brief is dense and structured for summation extraction."
- NEW DECISION: "cc-summation-link skill defines autonomous summation workflow with three-tier input priority and CC package format. Absorbs the format spec from cc-post-session-package."
- NEW DECISION: "cc-odrc-framework updated with purpose-driven links (advisory purpose per link, honest achievement assessment), tangent capture with idea affinity (tag at capture, not deferred), and advisory phase calculation (ratio-based, developer decides when to advance)."
- NEW DECISION: "cc-session-structure updated with chain model (working links + summation), 3-5 link guidance with link 3 check-in, split closing workflow (working vs summation), and three new principles: purpose scopes not constrains, transitions are cheap, context degrades so capture early."

### Rules

- NEW RULE: "Shorter high-quality sessions are preferred over longer degrading ones. Make transitions cheap so developers start fresh rather than squeezing exhausted context."
- NEW RULE: "Write session output while context is fresh, not at session close. Link briefs capture during the link; summation synthesizes from link briefs — output never depends on degraded context."
- NEW RULE: "Plan chains as N+1: N working links plus 1 summation link. Budget for summation as part of the chain, not an afterthought."
- NEW RULE: "Transcripts are primary source in summation; link briefs are fallback. Use the highest-fidelity source available."
- NEW RULE: "Tangent OPENs are captured with idea affinity at moment of capture, not deferred to triage. Ask 'does this relate to an existing idea?' immediately."
- NEW RULE: "Don't stack measurement before validating adoption of the simplest version. One rating before two; ratio before algorithms."
- NEW RULE: "Don't over-invest in phase calculation sophistication — the value is a quick gut-check, not precision."
- NEW RULE: "Chain length guided by 3-5 recommendation; beyond 5 is a risk signal for context fatigue and summation quality degradation."
- NEW RULE: "Don't delete cc-post-session-package until cc-summation-link is validated through at least one complete chain."

### Constraints

- NEW CONSTRAINT: "Claude Chat has finite context windows. Packaging workflows can't be heavy when context is strained — this is why summation is a dedicated link, not appended to the last working link."
- NEW CONSTRAINT: "Context windows are finite. Packaging can't be heavy when context is strained — the chain model distributes capture across links to avoid end-of-session quality collapse."

### Resolved OPENs

- RESOLVE OPEN: "Session close workflow — what happens at session end?" → Evolved into the chain model. Session close for working links produces restart doc + link brief. Chain close triggers a summation link that produces the CC package. Two different workflows for two different moments.
- RESOLVE OPEN: "Chain done signal — how does the developer/system know a chain is complete?" → Developer judgment guided by 3-5 link recommendation with chat check-in at link 3. Not enforced — the developer decides when the arc is complete.
- RESOLVE OPEN: "Should the summation link have its own skill?" → Yes — cc-summation-link. Complex, repeatable pattern that benefits from iteration and versioning.
- RESOLVE OPEN: "Phase calculation — how sophisticated should it be?" → Ratio-based only is fine. Advisory, not gatekeeping. Developer decides when to advance phases. Revisit if rating data shows patterns.

### Open OPENs (carried forward)

- OPEN: "Should filenames inside the zip be fully qualified or generic? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "Does cc-artifact-manifest skill get absorbed into cc-link-output or cc-summation-link, or remain standalone? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "How does CC trigger brief generation from ingested session data? What's the pipeline from upload to brief? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "What error handling does CC need for malformed session packages? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "When building briefs, does CC use cumulative ODRC only or also session debriefs for narrative context? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "Does the ODRC parser do reconciliation (dedup, conflict resolution) or simple append? (from S001)"
- OPEN: "What does the inter-session handoff look like vs the CC-bound package? Optimized for different consumers. (from Link 1)"
- OPEN: "Does CC get one consolidated package per chain or full chain history? (from Link 1)"
- OPEN: "Does summation link need restart docs or just link briefs as input? (from Link 1)"
- OPEN: "Can CC measure warm-up quality programmatically, or is it developer-reported? (from Link 1)"
- OPEN: "How does CC handle OPENs that don't belong to the current idea? Orphan detection, reassignment, periodic review. (from Link 2)"
- OPEN: "Should CC support a dedicated realignment session mode for triaging OPENs across ideas? (from Link 2)"
- OPEN: "How do OPENs get tagged with idea affinity at capture time in practice — what's the UX in chat? (from Link 2)"
- OPEN: "Evaluation criteria for briefs-only summation beyond 'did the next session start well'? (from Link 2)"
- OPEN: "Should there be a second rating point for brief/handoff quality? Parked until first rating adoption is validated. (from Link 2)"

## Session Notes

### What Was Accomplished
A three-link chain plus summation that evolved the session-to-CC pipeline from single-session uploads to a chain-based workflow. The chain arc moved from open exploration of the transition cost problem (Link 1), through detailed decision-making on chain mechanics and operational philosophy (Link 2), to production of four skill files codifying the entire system (Link 3). The summation link (Link 4) consolidated the chain into this CC-ingestible package.

The chain produced 25 new decisions, 9 rules, 2 constraints, resolved 4 OPENs, and carries forward 15 open OPENs. Four skill files were drafted: cc-link-output (new), cc-summation-link (new), cc-odrc-framework (updated), cc-session-structure (updated).

### Key Design Principles Established
- Make transitions cheap so developers prefer short, high-quality sessions over long, degrading ones
- Purpose-driven links: declare intent, measure achievement, capture tangents without derailing
- Developer autonomy over system control: every feature advisory, never gatekeeping
- Measure simply, validate adoption, then add complexity
- The debrief is the highest-value artifact — give it the best conditions (fresh context, dedicated link)
- Write output while context is fresh, never at the degraded end of a session

### Session Status
- Concepts: 15 OPENs, 25 DECISIONs (this chain) + 7 PRIOR DECISIONs (S001), 9 RULEs, 2 CONSTRAINTs
- Phase: converging (chain model designed and codified in skills; CC integration and validation remain)
- Next session: Install and validate the four skill files through a real chain. Test cc-link-output and cc-summation-link end-to-end. Retire cc-post-session-package if validated.
